#Listing of the different conceptual steps to take. 

# rationale
detect synyonm at low or high frequence
detect nonsym at high frequency


# to keep in mind 
-  Graur et al: any change at position 1 and 2 of the codon is always (95% and 100%) nonsynonymous. 


# datasets
1. Bacheler dataset -> see script of the analysis
2. Prep dataset: to check for similar patterns 






#Ideas

1. for each site,  calculate substitution frequencies and impact on AA (syn,nonsyn,stop)
  - rank according to frequency
  - double check stop codons (double mutant problem -> check also impact on AA and frequencies
  - positional ranking-> detect regions with low substitutions
