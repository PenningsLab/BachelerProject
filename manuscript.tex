
\section{Introduction}

This study aimed to determine the cost a mutation. 


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Simulation Experiments}
Run simulations: number of patients, the number of reads to determine costly at 1\%, 2\%, etc. Dependent on the population size of the virus, the number of patients and the number of reads.
